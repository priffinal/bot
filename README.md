# bot
My first Discord bot
1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications, click on 'New application', name whatever you want
2. Click on the bot, select 'OAuth2', click on 'bot' and select permissions that you want, then copy the link, invite it to your server
3. On 'Bot', copy the token, paste it into the code, replace it with the 'TOKEN'
